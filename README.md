# Walmart-MLE-Evaluation

## Data Science Project Scenario

1. **Sources**

Dataset

Use the public Microsoft Azure Predictive Maintenance dataset on Kaggle:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabbiswas1/microsoft-azure-predictive-maintenance/data

Goal

Build an end-to-end ML solution that predicts whether a machine will fail in the near future, using the provided dataset. Focus on clean engineering and deployment craftsmanship; the modelling can be simple if it is defensible.

2. **Core Expectations**

- **Reproducibility** – can we run it straight away?
- **Software Engineering** – code quality, design, structure, modern Python practices.
- **MLOps/Maturity** – ML life cycle, deployment, automation & maintainability.
- **Documentation** – is your reasoning, process and system well-explained and easy to follow?
- **Model performance** – sensible approach and metrics (state-of-the-art not required).
